# Events Visualizer GPTI

Crowdfunding for social purposes

### Code Guidelines :blue_book:

- **Github-flow**: We use (github flow)[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow] to add changes. TLDR: Each change must be added in a branch and pull requested to main.
- **Strandard commits**: commits should follow this [guide](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary). Example `feat(backend): CRUD events`.
  - The commits should have names `feature`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, if the implemented code does not fit this names, another one can be added.
- **Meaningful branch names**: branch should be `feature/name-branch`, where the name branch should be descriptive of what is beign implemented, example: `feature/crud-events`.
- **Code Reviews**: Self review in every pull request, tag a member of your team and make a code review and aprove :white_check_mark: the changes before merge.

This gidelines makes us all work with ease and understand others code :yum:
